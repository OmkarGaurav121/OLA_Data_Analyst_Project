## 📌 Project Insights

Here are some key findings from the Ola ride booking dataset:

- ✅ **62% of rides were successfully completed**, with consistent booking growth over weekends.
- 💳 **UPI and Cash** dominated payment methods, with UPI accounting for over 40% of total transactions.
- 🚕 **Prime Sedan and Auto** were the most used vehicle types across Bengaluru.
- ❌ Most common cancellation reasons:
  - **Customers:** Driver not moving toward pickup
  - **Drivers:** Personal or car-related issues
- 🔥 **Revenue peaked on match days and weekends**, with top 5 customers contributing significantly to overall earnings.
- ⭐ **Driver and customer ratings** showed that bike rides received higher satisfaction scores than other modes.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Here’s how I plan to take this project further:

- ⚙️ **Automate data generation** using Python (Pandas + Faker)
- 📊 **Real-time dashboard** using Power BI with streaming data
- 📦 Integrate **REST APIs** to simulate live ride data
- 📈 Add **predictive analysis** using machine learning (e.g., ride cancellation likelihood)
- 🧹 **ETL automation** using SQL scripts and Power Query

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project allowed me to simulate a **real-world data analyst scenario** — from raw data creation to SQL analysis and dashboard visualization. I gained hands-on experience with:

- 📌 Building a data schema and cleaning logic in SQL  
- 📊 Creating dynamic insights with Power BI  
- 🧠 Answering business questions using real metrics  

I hope this project showcases my **technical ability**, **analytical thinking**, and **attention to detail**. I’m excited to bring these skills to the data industry.
